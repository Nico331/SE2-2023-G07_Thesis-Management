TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team 07)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done:<span style="color:green"> 9 committed and 5 done
- Total points committed vs. done: <span style="color:green">25 committed and 15 done
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team):<span style="color:green"> 112h 30m planned and 109h 45m done

**Remember** a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:

- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD if required (you cannot remove items!)


<span style="color:green">
All the unit and e2e tests for the completed stories are passing.

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)
  - Estimate:
    - Average = 2h 22m
    - Standard deviation = 2h 41m
  - Actual:
    - Average = 2h 37m
    - Standard deviation = 3h 2m
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1 : 112h 30m /109h 45m - 1 = 0.02

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 4h
  - Total hours spent: 4h
  - Nr of automated unit test cases: 20
  - Coverage (if available): 
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 2h
  - Total hours spent: 2h
- Code review:
  - Total hours estimated : 4h
  - Total hours spent: 3h
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

  > We understimate the mole of problem which could arise during the development.


- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
  > We should complete at first the user stories with higher priority.

  > We need more coordination between back-end and front-end.

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  
  > During this sprint the team has improved the communication.
  
  > We have added the E2E test as a task.
  
  > We did unit tests.
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
  > The work's organization could be improved in terms of clearer division of work between the team members.

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

  > We'll maybe have to write better and clearer code in order to avoid misunderstandings between us.

  > Test the software few days before the demo instead of the same day, we could achieve this improvement organizing the work in a better way.
  

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!

  > Everyone in the team participate actively and work hard.
