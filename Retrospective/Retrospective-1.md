TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team 07)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done:<span style="color:green"> 9 committed and 5 done
- Total points committed vs. done: <span style="color:green">25 committed and 15 done
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team):<span style="color:green"> 112h 30m planned and 109h 45m done

**Remember** a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:

- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD if required (you cannot remove items!)


<span style="color:green">
All the unit and e2e tests for the completed stories are passing.

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)
  - Estimate:
    - Average = 2h 22m
    - Standard deviation = 2h 41m
  - Actual:
    - Average = 2h 37m
    - Standard deviation = 3h 2m
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1 : 112h 30m /109h 45m - 1 = 0.02

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 4h
  - Total hours spent: 4h
  - Nr of automated unit test cases: 10
  - Coverage (if available): 
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 2h
  - Total hours spent: 2h
- Code review:
  - Total hours estimated : 4h
  - Total hours spent: 3h
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

  - <span style="color:green"> The lack of knolwedge of the skills of each group member lead us to an average underestimation of the tasks.
  - <span style="color:green"> The fact that we didn't include the E2E testing in our estimation.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
  - <span style="color:green"> We should start and complete a story at a time by developing and running all the tests before moving on to the next story. 

  - <span style="color:green"> We should learn to develop Unit tests and include them along with E2E testing in the sprint estimation.

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  
  <span style="color:green"> -
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
  
  <span style="color:green"> -

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

  > Learn to develop unit testing for backend and frontend

  > More communication in the group

  > Have a better organization spreading our working time among each day of the week

  >Include E2E testing as a separate task and estimate it

  >Work on a story at a time

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!

  > We managed to have a presentable structured application in only one sprint and to organize the work splitting it for seven people that are working at the same time.
